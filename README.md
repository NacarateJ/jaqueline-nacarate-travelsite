# Travel Site
The Travel Site Project is a basic travel destination website, leveraging HTML, CSS, and component thinking.

It was created for a screen size of 1280px wide by converting a creative mockup into a functional multi-page static site.

## Functionalities
The site has 5 Pages:

* Home Page - it has 4 sections: navigation bar (with working links for each destination page), hero, recommendations (with one card for each destination linked to the appropriate destination page) and footer;
* 3 Destinations Pages (Iceland, Greece, Hawaii) - each page has 3 sections: navigation bar (Same as Home Page), 3 Itinerary Cards for a 3 Day trip (Friday, Saturday,Sunday) and footer (Same as Home Page);
* Get Started Page - it has 3 sections: navigation bar (Same as Home Page), a form where the user can select a destination and travel dates that would be used to begin the booking process, and footer (Same as Home Page);

## Tech Stack
* HTML
* CSS
